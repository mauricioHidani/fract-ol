The Fract-ol project represents a design for visualizing complex group numbers 
using the Mandelbrot, Julia, or Burning Ship mathematical functions to see them 
in fractal representational desings.

## How is a fractal formed?

A fractal is generated by a mathematical function that repeatedly applies a 
formula to a complex number, which represents a specific point on the display 
through its pixel position. Each iteration of the function uses the result of 
the previous one to compute the next value.

During this process, the function attempts to approach a certain limit. In the 
case of common fractals like the Mandelbrot set, this limit involves 
determining whether the magnitude of the complex number remains below a 
specific threshold. Typically when its absolute value (or modulus) stays below 
2.

If the value remains within this limit after many iterations, the point is 
considered part of the fractal. Otherwise, if it escapes beyond the threshold, 
the point is colored according to how quickly it diverged. This produces the 
detailed, colorful, and often psychedelic patterns seen in fractal images. 
The more iterations performed, the more refined and detailed the edges of the 
fractal appear.
