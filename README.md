The Fract-ol project represents a design for visualizing complex group numbers 
using the Mandelbrot, Julia, or Burning Ship mathematical functions to see them 
in fractal representational desings.

## How a fractal is formed?

A fractal is formed by a mathematical function that depends on the complex 
number being processed at the moment, which is defined by its position on the 
display through its pixel. It attempts to approach a limit, which is defined as 
the square root for four.

Depending on the number of iterations that the fractal function is passed, 
which accumulates each result to calculate the next iteration, each iteration 
bring the result closer and closer to the limit, This forms the shape of the 
fractal and its details according to the number of iterations; after all, the 
more iterations, the closer it will be to the detail of the edge of the drawing.

However, there are cases where the number exceeds the limit, which results in a 
psychedelic color effect that depends on the distance from the edge to define 
the coloring, depending on how the color diffusion is chosen.
